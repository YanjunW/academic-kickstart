Hi, I am a Ph.D. student in the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof.Xiaokang Qiu](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~xqiu/).

My research area is programming languages, especially with interests on program synthesis, program verification and program analysis. I work on designing frameworks that generate provably-correct programs automatically according to both syntactic constraints and semantic specifications. I also work on techniques that analyze tree-related programs as well as check the correctness of program transformations. My recent research lies at the intersection of programming languages and computer network.

Before starting my studies at Purdue, I received my B.Eng. in Electrical Engineering at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China](http://english.hust.edu.cn/).
