# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Syntax-guided synthesis aims to find a program satisfying semantic specification as well as user-provided structural hypotheses. There are two main search strategies: concrete search, which systematically or stochastically enumerates all possible solutions, and symbolic search, which leverages a symbolic procedure to solve the synthesis problem. In this paper, we propose a gradual synthesis framework, a novel combination of the two strategies that combines the best of the two worlds. The framework is a synergy of three key ideas: height-based enumeration (solving the synthesis problem at every height symbolically); grammar extension (sim- plifying the synthesis problem using the failed candidate); and pure symbolic synthesis (ad hoc, decidable synthesis procedures for special classes of problems). We prototyped the gradual synthesis framework and evaluated it on a wide range of benchmarks. Experiments show that the new synthesis framework can solve many challenging synthesis problems not possible before."
